# Library screen should show empty state
- assertVisible: "No files yet"
- assertVisible: "Open an audio file to add it to your library"

# Tab bar should be visible
- assertVisible: "Library"
- assertVisible: "Player"
- assertVisible: "Clips"

# Take screenshot of initial state
- takeScreenshot: "01-empty-library"

# Navigate to Clips tab
- tapOn: "Clips"
- assertVisible: "No clips yet"

# We won't tap it since it's disabled
